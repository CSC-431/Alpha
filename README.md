The purpose of this project is to improve the efficiency of college students by providing students with a real-time reflection on their grades so as to visualize the learning process quantitatively and enable students to make plans for their improvement. In this project, we will build a web-based online grade calculator, which also includes functions of the calendar and checking the pending assignment. The project will target the current college student which will allow them to check and calculate their grades immediately via this website instead of doing this on their own.
